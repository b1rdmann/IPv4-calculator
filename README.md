# IPv4-calculator
## This is the first functional code in my jorney throug Python, will be updated in the future ##

Calculating an IPv4 address have never been simpler!
Just punch in numbers and program will calculate and show you your network and it's specifications:
  1. Network Address. 
  2. Minimal host address.
  3. Maximal host address.
  4. Broadcast address.
  5. Number of usable host addresses.
  
Can be useful for those, who work with IPv4.
Not any better than other IPv4 calculators, but it works as intended, and it makes me happy.
