# IPv4-calculator
## This is the first functional code in my jorney throug Python, will be updated in the future ##

Calculating an IPv4 address have never been simpler!
Just punch in numbers and program will calculate your subnet and show you it's specifications:
  1. Subnet Number: 
  2. Minimal address.
  3. Maximal address.
  4. Broadcast address
  5. Number of available node addresses.
  
Can be useful for those, who work with IPv4.
Not much better than any other IPv4 calculator, but it works as intended, and it makes me happy.
